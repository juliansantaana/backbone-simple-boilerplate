backbone-simple-boilerplate
===========================

A simple backbone boilerplate skeleton app, using everything I learned (and I continue learning) from backbone.js , and several
examples i found throughout the internet.
Thanks to everyone who shares their code on github and blogs and everything, this boilerplate is done using templates, and resources I found.

This is by not meaning the "correct" way to do it, it's just a way i found useful, and it works.
Feel free to suggest any changes, and hey! why don't you fork it and commit new stuff to it?
